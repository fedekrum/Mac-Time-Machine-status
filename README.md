# Mac-Time-Machine-status
A simple bash script to get more info on what Time Machine is doing.

Sometimes Time Machin status is unclear.
The "Preparing backup..." can take forever and I get anxious to know if there is any progress.
I made a script to check at least in what file the process is working on.
It must be run as root, so you will be prompted for credentials if you are not.
No modification is made on any file and no risky commands are run on the script as you can check.
